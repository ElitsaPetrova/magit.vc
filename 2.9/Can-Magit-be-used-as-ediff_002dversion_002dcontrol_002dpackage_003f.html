<!-- Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.
While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each
and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced
Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks
directly from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only
Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

<h4 class="subsection">A.1.5 Can Magit be used as <code>ediff-version-control-package</code>?</h4>

<p>No, it cannot.  For that to work the functions <code>ediff-magit-internal</code>
and <code>ediff-magit-merge-internal</code> would have to be implemented, and they
are not.  These two functions are only used by the three commands
<code>ediff-revision</code>, <code>ediff-merge-revisions-with-ancestor</code>, and
<code>ediff-merge-revisions</code>.
</p>
<p>These commands only delegate the task of populating buffers with
certain revisions to the &quot;internal&quot; functions.  The equally important
task of determining which revisions are to be compared/merged is not
delegated.  Instead this is done without any support whatsoever, from
the version control package/system - meaning that the user has to
enter the revisions explicitly.  Instead of implementing
<code>ediff-magit-internal</code> we provide <code>magit-ediff-compare</code>, which handles
both tasks like it is 2005.
</p>
<p>The other commands <code>ediff-merge-revisions</code> and
<code>ediff-merge-revisions-with-ancestor</code> are normally not what you want
when using a modern version control system like Git.  Instead of
letting the user resolve only those conflicts which Git could not
resolve on its own, they throw away all work done by Git and then
expect the user to manually merge all conflicts, including those that
had already been resolved.  That made sense back in the days when
version control systems couldn&rsquo;t merge (or so I have been told), but
not anymore.  Once in a blue moon you might actually want to see all
conflicts, in which case you <strong>can</strong> use these commands, which then use
<code>ediff-vc-merge-internal</code>.  So we don&rsquo;t actually have to implement
<code>ediff-magit-merge-internal</code>.  Instead we provide the more useful
command <code>magit-ediff-resolve</code> which only shows yet-to-be resolved
conflicts.

<!-- Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.
While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each
and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced
Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks
directly from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only
Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

<h3 class="section">A.4 Diffs are collapsed after un-/staging</h3>

<p>This typically happens on Windows and/or large repositories where
preparing diffs takes longer than <code>magit-diff-expansion-threshold</code>. The
default is one second, try increasing it to a larger value.
</p>
<p>Currently when one part of a Magit buffer has to be updated the whole
buffer is recreated from scratch.  That obviously isn&rsquo;t good for
performance and will be fixed eventually.  Meanwhile we need a kludge
that prevents the update from taking very long under certain
circumstances, e.g. when showing the difference for hundrets of
changes files.
</p>
<p>For that reason the variable <code>magit-diff-expansion-threshold</code> was added,
defaulting to one second.  If it takes longer than that to recreate a
Magit buffer, then no further diff sections are expanded because
that&rsquo;s one of the steps that take the longest.  If a diff is not
expanded, then some work can be delayed until it actually is.
</p>
<p>You can then still expand sections manually, but when you refresh the
complete buffer explicitly using <code>g</code> or by performing an action which
triggers a refresh, then previously expanded diffs could be collapsed.
You can set <code>magit-diff-expansion-threshold</code> to a higher value to
prevent that from happening.

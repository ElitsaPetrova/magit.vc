<!-- Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.
While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each
and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced
Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks
directly from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only
Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

<h3 class="section">4.3 Automatic refresh and revert</h3>

<p>After running a command which may change the state of the current
repository, the current Magit buffer and the corresponding status
buffer are refreshed.  Status buffer may optionally be automatically
refreshed whenever a buffer is saved to a file inside the respective
repository.
</p>
<p>Automatically refreshing Magit buffers ensures that the displayed
information is up-to-date most of the time but can lead to a
noticeable delay in big repositories.  Other Magit buffers are not
refreshed to keep the delay to a minimum and also because doing so can
sometimes be undesirable.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-magit_002drevert_002dbuffers-1"></a>User Option: <strong>magit-revert-buffers</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option controls if and how file-visiting buffers in the current
repository are reverted.
</p>
<p>Unmodified buffers visiting files belonging to the current
repository may be reverted after refreshing the current Magit buffer
and after running certain other commands.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>nil</code>

<p>Don&rsquo;t revert any buffers.
</p>

</li><li> <code>ask</code>

<p>List the buffers which might potentially have to be reverted and
ask the user whether she wants to revert them.  If so, then do it
synchronously.
</p>

</li><li> <code>t</code>

<p>Revert the buffers synchronously, mentioning each one as it is
being reverted and then also show a summary in the echo area.
</p>

</li><li> <code>usage</code>

<p>Like <code>t</code> but include usage information in the summary.  This is the
default so that users come here and pick what is right for them.
</p>

</li><li> <code>silent</code>

<p>Revert the buffers synchronously and be quiet about it.
</p>
<p>This is the recommended setting, because for the other values the
revert messages might prevent you from seeing other, more
important, messages in the echo area.
</p>

</li><li> NUMBER

<p>An integer or float.  Revert the buffers asynchronously,
mentioning each one as it is being reverted.  If user input
arrives, then stop reverting.  After NUMBER seconds resume
reverting.
</p></li></ul>
</dd></dl>

<p>Buffers can also be refreshed explicitly, which is useful in buffers
that weren&rsquo;t current during the last refresh and after changes were
made to the repository outside of Magit.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-g"></a>
<a name="index-magit_002drefresh"></a>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>g</kbd> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<code>magit-refresh</code>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command refreshes the current buffer if its major mode derives
from <code>magit-mode</code> as well as the corresponding status buffer.
</p>
<p>If the option <code>magit-revert-buffers</code> calls for it, then it also
reverts all unmodified buffers that visit files being tracked in the
current repository.
</p>
<a name="index-G"></a>
<a name="index-magit_002drefresh_002dall"></a>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>G</kbd> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<code>magit-refresh-all</code>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command refreshes all Magit buffers belonging to the current
repository and also reverts all unmodified buffers that visit files
being tracked in the current repository.
</p>
<p>The file-visiting buffers are always reverted, even if
<code>magit-revert-buffers</code> is nil.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-magit_002dafter_002dsave_002drefresh_002dstatus"></a>Function: <strong>magit-after-save-refresh-status</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This function is intended to be added to <code>after-save-hook</code>.  After
doing that the corresponding status buffer is refreshed whenever a
buffer is saved to a file inside a repository.
</p>
<p>Note that refreshing a Magit buffer is done by re-creating its
contents from scratch, which can be slow in large repositories.  If
you are not satisfied with Magit&rsquo;s performance, then you should
obviously not add this function to that hook.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-magit_002drefresh_002dbuffer_002dhook"></a>User Option: <strong>magit-refresh-buffer-hook</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This hook is run in each Magit buffer that was refreshed during the
current refresh - normally the current buffer and the status buffer.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-magit_002dafter_002drevert_002dhook"></a>User Option: <strong>magit-after-revert-hook</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This hook is run in each file-visiting buffer belonging to the
current repository that was actually reverted during a refresh.
</p>
<p>Note that adding something here is very expensive.  If you
experience performance issues, you might want to check this hook, as
well as <code>magit-not-reverted-hook</code> and, if possible, remove some of the
functions added by third-party packages.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-magit_002dnot_002dreverted_002dhook"></a>User Option: <strong>magit-not-reverted-hook</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This hook is run in each file-visiting buffer belonging to the
current repository that was reverted during a refresh.  The file
was not reverted because it did not change, and so Magit does not
have to do anything.  This hook is intended for third-party
extensions that need to run some functions even on such files.

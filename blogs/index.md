* [I like Magit, the GNU Emacs package for Git](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/MagitPraise) by Chris Siebenmann &mdash; 2015.12

  Magit rocks for selectively staging changes, so much so that I think
  it's worth turning to GNU Emacs with Magit for this if you need it,
  even if you regularly edit in something else.

  I don’t hate git solely because of magit. Although it is an Emacs
  package, I strongly recommend it even to non-Emacs users just
  because of how useful it is.

  I’m actually so dependent on magit that I’m significantly less
  effective with other vc’s since they don’t have a magit-like
  frontend for me to use.

* [Magit](http://randycoulman.com/blog/2014/10/21/magit/) by Randy Coulman &mdash; 2014.10

  When we decided to migrate to Git a few years ago, I decided to try
  Magit in Emacs as a front-end, and I’ve never looked back.

Some users have also published [screencasts](/screencasts)
and [wrote](/quotes) nice things I like to quote.

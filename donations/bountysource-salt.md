## It's Magit! A Git Porcelain inside Emacs

Magit is an interface to the version control system
[Git](http://git-scm.com), implemented as an
[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs) package.  Magit aspires to
be a complete Git porcelain.  While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit
wraps and improves upon each and every Git command, it is complete
enough to allow even experienced Git users to perform almost all of
their daily version control tasks directly from within Emacs.  While
many fine Git clients exist, only Magit and Git itself deserve to be
called porcelains. [(more)](http://magit.vc/about.html).

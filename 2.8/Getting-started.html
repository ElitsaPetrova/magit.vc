<!-- Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.
While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each
and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced
Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks
directly from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only
Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Getting started</h2>

<p>This section describes the most essential features that many
Magitians use on a daily basis.  It only scratches the surface but
should be enough to get you started.
</p>
<p>(You might want to create a repository just for this walk-through,
e.g. by cloning an existing repository.  If you don&rsquo;t use a separate
repository then make sure you create a snapshot as described below).
</p>
<p>To display information about the current Git repository, type <code>M-x
magit-status</code>.  You will be doing that so often that it is best to bind
this command globally:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-x g&quot;) 'magit-status)
</pre></div>

<p>Most Magit commands are commonly invoked from this buffer.  It should
be considered the primary interface to interact with Git using Magit.
There are many other Magit buffers, but they are usually created from
this buffer.
</p>
<p>Depending on what state your repository is in, this buffer will
contain sections titled &quot;Staged changes&quot;, &quot;Unstaged changes&quot;,
&quot;Unpulled commits&quot;, &quot;Unpushed commits&quot;, and/or some others.
</p>
<p>If some staged and/or unstaged changes exist, you should back them up
now.  Type <code>z</code> to show the stashing popup buffer featuring various stash
variants and arguments that can be passed to these commands.  Do not
worry about those for now, just type <code>Z</code> (uppercase) to create a stash
while also keeping the index and work tree intact.  The status buffer
should now also contain a section titled &quot;Stashes&quot;.
</p>
<p>Otherwise, if there are no uncommitted changes, you should create some
now by editing and saving some of the tracked files.  Then go back to
the status buffer, while at the same time refreshing it, by typing <code>C-x
g</code>.  (When the status buffer, or any Magit buffer for that matter, is
the current buffer, then you can also use just <code>g</code> to refresh it).
</p>
<p>Move between sections using <code>p</code> and <code>n</code>.  Note that the bodies of some
sections are hidden.  Type <code>TAB</code> to expand or collapse the section at
point.  You can also use <code>C-tab</code> to cycle the visibility of the current
section and its children. Move to a file section inside the section
named &quot;Unstaged changes&quot; and type <code>s</code> to stage the changes you have made
to that file. That file now appears under &quot;Staged changes&quot;.
</p>
<p>Magit can stage and unstage individual hunks, not just complete files.
Move to the file you have just staged, expand it using <code>TAB</code>, move to
one of the hunks using <code>n</code>, and unstage just that by typing <code>u</code>.  Note how
the staging (<code>s</code>) and unstaging (<code>u</code>) commands operate on the change at
point.  Many other commands behave the same way.
</p>
<p>You can also un-/stage just part of a hunk.  Inside the body of a hunk
section (move there using <code>C-n</code>), set the mark using <code>C-SPC</code> and move down
until some added and removed lines fall inside the region but not all
of them.  Again type <code>s</code> to stage.
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also possible to un-/stage multiple files at once.  Move to a
file section, type <code>C-SPC</code>, move to the next file using <code>n</code>, and then <code>s</code> to
stage both files.  Note that both the mark and point have to be on the
headings of sibling sections for this to work.  If the region looks
like it does in other buffers, then it doesn&rsquo;t select Magit sections
that can be acted on as a unit.
</p>
<p>And then of course you want to commit your changes.  Type <code>c</code>.  This
shows the committing popup buffer featuring various commit variants
and arguments that can be passed to <code>git commit</code>.  Do not worry about
those for now.  We want to create a &quot;normal&quot; commit, which is done by
typing <code>c</code> again.
</p>
<p>Now two new buffers appear.  One is for writing the commit message,
the other shows a diff with the changes that are about to committed.
Write a message and then type <code>C-c C-c</code> to actually create the commit.
</p>
<p>You probably don&rsquo;t want to push the commit you just created because
you just committed some random changes, but if that is not the case
you could push it by typing <code>P</code> to bring up the push popup and then <code>u</code> to
push to the configured upstream.  (If the upstream is not configured,
then you would be prompted for the push target instead.)
</p>
<p>Instead we are going to undo the changes made so far.  Bring up the
log for the current branch by typing <code>l l</code>, move to the last commit
created before starting with this walk through using <code>n</code>, and do a hard
reset using <code>C-u x</code>.  <strong>WARNING</strong>: this discards all uncommitted changes.
If you did not follow the advice about using a separate repository for
these experiments and did not create a snapshot of uncommitted changes
before starting to try out Magit, then don&rsquo;t do this.
</p>
<p>So far we have mentioned the commit, push, and log popups.  These are
probably among the popups you will be using the most, but many others
exist.  To show a popup with all other popups (as well as the various
apply commands), type <code>h</code>.  Try a few.
</p>
<p>The key bindings in that popup correspond to the bindings in Magit
buffers, including but not limited to the status buffer.  So you could
type <code>h d</code> to bring up the diff popup, but once you remember that &quot;d&quot;
stands for &quot;diff&quot;, you would usually do so by just typing <code>d</code>.  But the
&quot;popup of popups&quot; is useful even once you have memorized all the
bindings, as it can provide easy access to Magit commands from
non-Magit buffers.  So you should bind this globally too:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-x M-g&quot;) 'magit-dispatch-popup)
</pre></div>

<p>You might also want to enable <code>global-magit-file-mode</code> (see <a href="Minor-mode-for-buffers-visiting-files.html#Minor-mode-for-buffers-visiting-files">Minor mode for buffers visiting files</a>).

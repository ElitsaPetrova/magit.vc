      <h2>The v1 series is obsolete and unmaintained</h2>
      <p>
        Being unmaintained means, among other things, that we won't
        fix any bugs.  If you think that is wrong of us, then consider
        that "we" is mostly "I", my time is limited, and that I have
        not used that series myself for more that one and a half years
        now.  For most of that time I actually did support the v1
        series, but that has come to an end now.  For more information
        see the release notes for
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magit/magit/master/Documentation/RelNotes/1.4.0.txt">1.4.0</a> and
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magit/magit/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.1.0.txt">2.1.0</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, for your convenience, I am now making v1.4.2, the
        last release in the v1 series, available from this dedicated
        Elpa archive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Never-the-less <b>if it is at all possible, then you should
        instead update to the v2 series</b>.  That requires at least
        Emacs v24.4 and Git v1.9.4.
      </p>
      <p>
        If these releases are not available in your distribution, then
        you should look for backports.  If no backports are available,
        then you should compile from source.  If you require
        permission to install software, then you should ask for it.
        You should only consider installing v1 instead of v2, if, and
        only if, your employer forbids that you install recent
        versions of Emacs and Git.  In all other cases it would be
        much better to learn to install Emacs and/or Git from source.
        It's really not that hard and is a skill worth having.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently we do not provide any distribution specific
        instructions for installing Emacs and Git, but should such
        instructions be contributed by users, then they would appear
        <a href="http://magit.vc/manual/magit/I-am-using-an-Emacs-release-older-than-244.html">here</a> and
        <a href="http://magit.vc/manual/magit/I-am-using-a-Git-release-older-than-194.html">here</a>.
        (Note that you could be that user who contributes those
        instructions for your distribution.)

      <h2>How to install v1 if that's the only option</h2>
      <p>
        If you have already installed v2 (>=20150601 on Melpa) then
        you have to first uninstall <code>magit</code>
        and <code>git-commit</code>.  Then restart Emacs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add the <code>magit-v1</code> archive
        to <code>package-archives</code>.  If you are also using other
        archives, then you have to pin the <code>magit</code> package
        to the <code>magit-v1</code> archive
        using <code>package-pinned-packages</code>.  If your Emacs
        does not have that variable, then you have to install and
        <a href="http://melpa.org/#/getting-started">configure</a>
        the <code>package-filter</code> package which is available
        from Melpa.
      </p>

title: Buy Sticker Sheets
---

Some users who missed the Kickstarter campaign have asked whether they
can still buy some stickers.  And now you finally can!

The first offer is good as long as I have stickers left.  I don't have
that many, so better hurry.  The second offer is good for one week or
so (to give everyone a change to get at least one sheet).

The price for one sticker sheet is the same as it was during the
Kickstarter campaign.  The shipping cost is $2.

The sticker sheets are 14.6 x 12.7cm (5.75 x 5 inches) in size.

## Donated in the past and want some stickers now?

If you have donated in the past and would like a free sticker sheet,
then send me an email whose subject begins with "[stickers] ".  You
can find my address in the commit log or by concatenating my first and
last name and inserting "@" at the only place that makes sense and "."
at the only place that results in a valid address.

## Don't need any stickers?

You can also [support](/donate) my work on Magit without buying anything.

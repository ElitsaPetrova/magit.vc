<!-- The library with-editor makes it easy to use the Emacsclient as
the $EDITOR of child processes, making sure they know how to call
home.  For remote processes a substitute is provided, which communicates
with Emacs on standard output instead of using a socket as the Emacsclient
does.

This library was written because Magit has to be able to do the above
to allow the user to edit commit messages gracefully and to edit
rebase sequences, which wouldn't be possible at all otherwise.

Because other packages can benefit from such functionality, this
library is made available as a separate package.  It also defines some
additional functionality which makes it useful even for end-users, who
don't use Magit or another package which uses it internally.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Using With-Editor as a library</h2>

<p>This section describes how to use the <tt>with-editor</tt> library <em>outside</em> of
Magit to teach another package how to have its child processes call
home, just like Magit does.  You don&rsquo;t need to know any of this just
to create commits using Magit.  You can also ignore this if you use
<tt>with-editor</tt> outside of Magit, but only as an end-user.
</p>
<p>For information about interactive use and options which affect both
interactive and non-interactive use, see <a href="Using-the-With_002dEditor-package.html#Using-the-With_002dEditor-package">Using the With-Editor
package</a>.

<dt><a name="index-with_002deditor"></a>Macro: <strong>with-editor</strong> <em>&amp;rest body</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This macro arranges for the emacsclient or the sleeping editor to be
used as the editor of child processes, effectively teaching them to
call home to the current emacs instance when they require that the
user edits a file.
</p>
<p>This is essentially done by establishing a local binding for
<code>process-environment</code> and changing the value of the <code>$EDITOR</code>
environment variable.  This affects all processes started by forms
inside BODY.

<dt><a name="index-with_002deditor_002dset_002dprocess_002dfilter"></a>Function: <strong>with-editor-set-process-filter</strong> <em>process filter</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This function is like <code>set-process-filter</code> but ensures that adding the
new FILTER does not remove the <code>with-editor-process-filter</code>.  This is
done by wrapping the two filter functions using a lambda, which
becomes the actual filter.  It calls <code>with-editor-process-filter</code>
first, passing <code>t</code> as NO-STANDARD-FILTER.  Then it calls FILTER.

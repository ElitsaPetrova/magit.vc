<!-- Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.
While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each
and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced
Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks
directly from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only
Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

<h4 class="subsection">9.2.2 Performance</h4>

<p>Magit is slower than raw Git because it does more.  For example <code>git
commit</code> creates a commit and that&rsquo;s it.  <code>magit-commit</code> also updates the
current Magit buffer to make sure you are not looking at outdated
information without noticing it.  To refresh the status buffer, Magit
has to run Git a dozen times or more, making it slower than <code>git
status</code>, but also much more informative.  Magit also optionally reverts
file-visiting buffers, creates backups, runs hooks where third-party
extensions can do their slow thing, etc.
</p>
<p>I do care about performance and try to optimize for it as much as
possible, but many features simply come with an inherent performance
penalty.  When a feature is just too slow given certain usage and
repository characteristics, then it often can be disabled, globally or
on a per-repository basis.
</p>
<p>But first a short list of performance issues that cannot easily be
worked around:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Creating a new process on MS Windows is much slower than on
POSIX-compatible systems.  This is a problem because Magit creates a
lot of child processes to retrieve information from Git.  In the
short run, only switching to a POSIX system can fix this.  Of course
this could also be fixed in Windows itself, but I am just one unpaid
person while Microsoft is a billion dollar company, so I will leave
it to them to fix this grave flaw in their OS.


</li><li> When showing logs, Magit limits the number of commits initially
shown in the hope that this avoids unnecessary work.  When using
<code>--graph</code> this unfortunately does not have the desired effect for
large histories.  Junio said on the git mailing list
(<a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/git/msg232230.html">http://www.spinics.net/lists/git/msg232230.html</a>): &quot;<code>--graph</code> wants to
compute the whole history and the max-count only affects the output
phase after <code>--graph</code> does its computation&quot;.

<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s not that Git is slow at outputting the
differences, or that Magit is slow at parsing the output - the
problem is that Git first goes outside and has a smoke.  This has to
be fixed in Git but so far nobody volunteered to do it.  Maybe you
could do that?
</p>

</li><li> Whenever &quot;something changes&quot;, Magit &quot;refreshes&quot; the status buffer and
the current Magit buffer by recreating them from scratch.  This is
an old design decision that we couldn&rsquo;t depart from easily.  And it
has its benefits too - most importantly it&rsquo;s much simpler and less
error prone to do it this way than to only refreshing &quot;what actually
has changed&quot; (that would basically be a huge collection of special
cases).  So for now at least, we don&rsquo;t avoid recreating the buffer
content and instead focus on making doing so faster.
</li></ul>

<p>Now for the things that you can do to improve performance:
</p>
<p>Most optional features which can have a negative effect on performance
are disabled by default.  So start by checking the options you have
customized.  Even the potentially slow features are expected to only
lead to barely noticeable delays, but your mileage may vary.  Also
note that it is now possible to set options on a per-repository or
per-repository-class basis.  See <a href="Per_002drepository-configuration.html#Per_002drepository-configuration">Per-repository configuration</a>.
</p>
<p>You should check the values of at least the following variables:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>magit-after-revert-hook</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-diff-auto-show</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-diff-highlight-hunk-body</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-diff-highlight-indentation</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-diff-highlight-whitespace</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-diff-paint-whitespace</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-diff-refine-hunk</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-not-reverted-hook</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-refresh-buffer-hook</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-status-refresh-hook</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-wip-after-apply-mode</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-wip-after-save-mode</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-wip-before-change-mode</code>
</li></ul>

<p>Also note that everything involving &quot;cherry commits&quot; is slow.
</p>
<p>If nothing helps, then feel free to open a new issue.  Please provide
benchmarks.

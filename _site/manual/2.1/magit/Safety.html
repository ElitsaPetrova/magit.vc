<!-- Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.
While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each
and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced
Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks
directly from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only
Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

<h4 class="subsection">9.2.1 Safety</h4>

<p>This section discusses various variables that you might want to
change (or <strong>not</strong> change) for safety reasons.
</p>
<p>Git keeps <strong>committed</strong> changes around long enough for users to recover
changes they have accidentally deleted.  It does not do the same for
<strong>uncommitted</strong> changes in the working tree and not even the index (the
staging area).  Because Magit makes it so easy to modify uncommitted
changes, it also makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot in the
process.  For that reason Magit provides three global modes that save
<strong>tracked</strong> files to work-in-progress references after or before certain
actions.  See <a href="Wip-Modes.html#Wip-Modes">Wip Modes</a>.
</p>
<p>These modes are not enabled by default because of performance
concerns.  Instead a lot of potentially destructive commands require
confirmation every time they are used.  In many cases this can be
disabled by adding a symbol to <code>magit-no-confirm</code> (see <a href="Completion-and-confirmation.html#Completion-and-confirmation">Completion and confirmation</a>).  If you enable the various wip modes then you should
add <code>safe-with-wip</code> to this list.
</p>
<p>Similarly it isn&rsquo;t necessary to require confirmation before moving a
file to the system trash - if you trashed a file by mistake then you
can recover it from the there.  Option <code>magit-delete-by-moving-to-trash</code>
controls whether the system trash is used, which is the case by default.
Nevertheless, <code>trash</code> isn&rsquo;t a member of <code>magit-no-confirm</code> - you
might want to change that.
</p>
<p>Buffers visiting files tracked in the current repository are being
refreshed before certain actions.  See <a href="Automatic-refresh-and-revert.html#Automatic-refresh-and-revert">Automatic refresh and revert</a>.
This isn&rsquo;t as risky as it might seem.  If a buffer is modified
(i.e. it contains changes that haven&rsquo;t been saved yet), then
Emacs/Magit would refuse to revert it.  If the buffer has been saved
resulting in what is seen by Git as an uncommitted change, then Git in
turn would refuse to carry out the action that would cause these
changes to be lost.  Since Git doesn&rsquo;t do anything, the file doesn&rsquo;t
change on disk, and Emacs/Magit has nothing to revert.
</p>
<p>However if you do modify some files, visit the respective files in
Emacs, somehow discard the changes (not using Magit and probably even
outside Emacs), and then expect the respective file-visiting buffers
to retain the uncommitted changes, then the automatic reverting would
actually be harmful.  In other words if you use file-visiting buffers
as a sort of &quot;staging area&quot;, then you should set <code>magit-revert-buffers</code>
to <code>nil</code>.
</p>
<p>So far I have only heard from one user who uses such a workflow.  But
because there might be some other users doing such things, and I don&rsquo;t
want to be responsible for data loss, these reverts by default happen
quite verbosely, allowing these few users to undo the reverts using
the <code>undo</code> command and then disabling the automatic reverts for the
future.  Most users should however keep automatic reverts turned on
and instead configure it to be less verbose by setting
<code>magit-revert-buffers</code> to <code>t</code> or even <code>silent</code>.

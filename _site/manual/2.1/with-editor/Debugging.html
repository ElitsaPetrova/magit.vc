<!-- The library with-editor makes it easy to use the Emacsclient as
the $EDITOR of child processes, making sure they know how to call
home.  For remote processes a substitute is provided, which communicates
with Emacs on standard output instead of using a socket as the Emacsclient
does.

This library was written because Magit has to be able to do the above
to allow the user to edit commit messages gracefully and to edit
rebase sequences, which wouldn't be possible at all otherwise.

Because other packages can benefit from such functionality, this
library is made available as a separate package.  It also defines some
additional functionality which makes it useful even for end-users, who
don't use Magit or another package which uses it internally.

<p>With-Editor tries very hard to locate a suitable emacsclient
executable, and then sets option <code>with-editor-emacsclient-executable</code>
accordingly.  In very rare cases this fails.  When it does fail, then
the most likely reason is that someone found yet another way to
package Emacs (most likely on OS X) without putting the executable on
<code>$PATH</code>, and we have to add another kludge to find it anyway.
</p>
<p>If you are having problems using <code>with-editor</code>, e.g. you cannot commit
in Magit, then please open a new issue at
<a href="https://github.com/magit/magit/issues">https://github.com/magit/magit/issues</a> and provide information about
your Emacs installation.  Most importantly how did you install Emacs
and what is the output of <code>M-x with-editor-debug</code>?
</p>

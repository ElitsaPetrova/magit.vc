<!-- Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.

Unlike Emacs's native Version Control package which strives to
provide a unified interface to various version control systems, Magit
only supports Git and can therefor better take advantage of its native
features.

You are looking at the manual for the 1.4 series.

<h2 class="chapter">7 History</h2>

<p>To show the repository history of your current head, type <kbd>l l</kbd>.  A
new buffer will be shown that displays the history in a terse form.
The first paragraph of each commit message is displayed, next to a
representation of the relationships between commits.
</p>
<p>To show the repository history between two branches or between any two
points of the history, type <kbd>l r l</kbd>.  You will be prompted to enter
references for starting point and ending point of the history range; you
can use auto-completion to specify them.  A typical use case for ranged
history log display would be <kbd>l r l master RET new-feature RET</kbd> that
will display commits on the new-feature branch that are not in master;
these commits can then be inspected and cherry-picked, for example.
</p>
<p>More thorough filtering can be done by supplying <kbd>l</kbd> with one or
more suffix arguments, as displayed in its popup.  <kbd>=g</kbd> (&rsquo;Grep&rsquo;)
for example, limits the output to commits of which the log message
matches a specific string/regex.
</p>
<p>Typing <kbd>l L</kbd> (or <kbd>l C-u L</kbd>) will show the log in a more verbose
form.
</p>
<p>Magit will show only <code>magit-log-cutoff-length</code> entries.  <kbd>e</kbd>
will show twice as many entries.  <kbd>C-u e</kbd> will show all entries,
and given a numeric prefix argument, <kbd>e</kbd> will add this number of
entries.
</p>
<p>You can move point to a commit and then cause various things to happen
with it.  (The following commands work in any list of commits, such as
the one shown in the <em>Unpushed commits</em> section.)
</p>
<p>Typing <kbd>RET</kbd> will pop up more information about the current commit
and move point into the new buffer.  See <a href="Commit-Buffer.html#Commit-Buffer">Commit Buffer</a>.  Typing
<kbd>SPC</kbd> and <kbd>DEL</kbd> will also show the information, but will
scroll the new buffer up or down (respectively) when typed again.
</p>
<p>Typing <kbd>a</kbd> will apply the current commit to your current branch.
This is useful when you are browsing the history of some other branch
and you want to &lsquo;cherry-pick&rsquo; some changes from it.  A typical
situation is applying selected bug fixes from the development version
of a program to a release branch.  The cherry-picked changes will not
be committed automatically; you need to do that explicitly.
</p>
<p>Typing <kbd>A</kbd> will cherry-pick the current commit and will also
commit the changes automatically when there have not been any
conflicts.
</p>
<p>Typing <kbd>v</kbd> will revert the current commit.  Thus, it will apply
the changes made by that commit in reverse.  This is obviously useful
to cleanly undo changes that turned out to be wrong.  As with <kbd>a</kbd>,
you need to commit the changes explicitly.
</p>
<p>Typing <kbd>C-w</kbd> will copy the sha1 of the current commit into the
kill ring.
</p>
<p>Typing <kbd>=</kbd> will show the differences from the current commit to
the <em>marked</em> commit.
</p>
<p>You can mark the current commit by typing <kbd>.</kbd>.  When the current
commit is already marked, typing <kbd>.</kbd> will unmark it.  To unmark
the marked commit no matter where point is, use <kbd>C-u .</kbd>.
</p>
<p>Some commands, such as <kbd>=</kbd>, will use the current commit and the
marked commit as implicit arguments.  Other commands will offer the
marked commit as a default when prompting for their arguments.

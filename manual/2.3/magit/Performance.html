<!-- Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.
While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each
and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced
Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks
directly from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only
Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

<h4 class="subsection">9.2.2 Performance</h4>

<p>Magit is slower than raw Git because it does more.  For example <code>git
commit</code> creates a commit and that&rsquo;s it.  <code>magit-commit</code> also updates the
current Magit buffer to make sure you are not looking at outdated
information without noticing it.  To refresh the status buffer, Magit
has to run Git a dozen times or more, making it slower than <code>git
status</code>, but also much more informative.  Magit also optionally reverts
file-visiting buffers, creates backups, runs hooks where third-party
extensions can do their slow thing, etc.
</p>
<p>I do care about performance and try to optimize for it as much as
possible, but many features simply come with an inherent performance
penalty.  When a feature is just too slow given certain usage and
repository characteristics, then it often can be disabled, globally or
on a per-repository basis.
</p>
<p>But first a short list of performance issues that cannot easily be
worked around:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Creating a new process on MS Windows is much slower than on
POSIX-compatible systems.  This is a problem because Magit creates a
lot of child processes to retrieve information from Git.  In the
short run, only switching to a POSIX system can fix this.  Of course
this could also be fixed in Windows itself, but I am just one unpaid
person while Microsoft is a billion dollar company, so I will leave
it to them to fix this grave flaw in their OS.


</li><li> When showing logs, Magit limits the number of commits initially
shown in the hope that this avoids unnecessary work.  When using
<code>--graph</code> this unfortunately does not have the desired effect for
large histories.  Junio said on the git mailing list
(<a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/git/msg232230.html">http://www.spinics.net/lists/git/msg232230.html</a>): &quot;<code>--graph</code> wants to
compute the whole history and the max-count only affects the output
phase after <code>--graph</code> does its computation&quot;.

<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s not that Git is slow at outputting the
differences, or that Magit is slow at parsing the output - the
problem is that Git first goes outside and has a smoke.
</p>
<p>We actually work around this issue by limiting the commit not only
using <code>-&lt;N&gt;</code> but also using a range.  But unfortunately that&rsquo;s not
always possible.
</p>

</li><li> Whenever &quot;something changes&quot;, Magit &quot;refreshes&quot; the status buffer and
the current Magit buffer by recreating them from scratch.  This is
an old design decision that we couldn&rsquo;t depart from easily.  And it
has its benefits too - most importantly it&rsquo;s much simpler and less
error prone to do it this way than to only refreshing &quot;what actually
has changed&quot; (that would basically be a huge collection of special
cases).  So for now at least, we don&rsquo;t avoid recreating the buffer
content and instead focus on making doing so faster.
</li></ul>

<p>Now for the things that you can do to improve performance:
</p>
<p>Most optional features which can have a negative effect on performance
are disabled by default.  So start by checking the options you have
explicitly enabled.  Even the potentially slow features are expected
to only lead to barely noticeable delays, but your mileage may vary.
Also note that it is now possible to set options on a per-repository
or per-repository-class basis.  See <a href="Per_002drepository-configuration.html#Per_002drepository-configuration">Per-repository configuration</a>.
</p>
<p>You should check the values of at least the following variables:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>magit-after-revert-hook</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-diff-auto-show</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-diff-highlight-hunk-body</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-diff-highlight-indentation</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-diff-highlight-trailing</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-diff-paint-whitespace</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-diff-refine-hunk</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-log-arguments</code>, <code>magit-log-select-arguments</code>, and
<code>magit-log-section-arguments</code>

<p>In repositories with more than a few thousand commits <code>--graph</code> should
never be a member of <code>magit-log-section-arguments</code>.  That variable is
in the status buffer which is refreshed every time you run any Magit
command.
</p>
<p>Using <code>--color --graph</code> is even slower.  Magit uses code that is part
of Emacs to turn control characters into faces.  That code is pretty
slow and this is quite noticeable when showing a log with many
branches and merges.  For that reason <code>--color</code> is not enabled by
default anymore.  Consider leaving it at that.
</p>

</li><li> <code>magit-not-reverted-hook</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-refresh-buffer-hook</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-refs-sections-hook</code>

<p>When refreshing the &quot;references buffer&quot; is slow, then that&rsquo;s usually
because several hundred refs are being displayed.  The best way to
address that is to display fewer refs, obviously.
</p>
<p>If you are not, or only mildly, interested in seeing the list of
tags, then start by not displaying them:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(remove-hook 'magit-refs-sections-hook 'magit-insert-tags)
</pre></div>

<p>Then you should also make sure that the listed remote branches
actually all exist.  You can do so by pruning branches which no
longer exist using <code>f-pa</code>.
</p>

</li><li> <code>magit-status-refresh-hook</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-wip-after-apply-mode</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-wip-after-save-mode</code>

</li><li> <code>magit-wip-before-change-mode</code>
</li></ul>

<p>Also note that everything involving &quot;cherry commits&quot; is slow.
</p>
<p>If, after actually trying the above suggestions, performance is still
bad, and the above does not contain a statement explaining why that is
so in that particular case and that there is nothing that we can
currently do about it, then comment on the appropriate existing issue
(see <a href="https://github.com/magit/magit/labels/performance">https://github.com/magit/magit/labels/performance</a>), or if
necessary open a new issue.  Note that &quot;something is slow, I am using
v2.2&quot; is not helpful, you have to be a bit more specific.  Benchmarks
are a start.

<!-- Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.

Unlike Emacs's native Version Control package which strives to
provide a unified interface to various version control systems, Magit
only supports Git and can therefor better take advantage of its native
features.

You are looking at the manual for the obsolete 1.2 series.

<h2 class="chapter">20 Rewriting</h2>

<p>As hinted at earlier, you can rewrite your commit history.  For
example, you can reset the current head to an earlier commit with
<kbd>x</kbd>.  This leaves the working tree unchanged, and the status
buffer will show all the changes that have been made since that new
value of the current head.  You can commit these changes again,
possibly splitting them into multiple commits as you go along.
</p>
<p>Amending your last commit is a common special case of rewriting
history like this.
</p>
<p>Another common way to rewrite history is to reset the head to an
earlier commit, and then to cherry pick the previous commits in a
different order.  You could pick them from the reflog, for example.
</p>
<p>Magit has several commands that can simplify the book keeping
associated with rewriting.  These commands all start with the <kbd>r</kbd>
prefix key.
</p>
<p>Typing <kbd>r b</kbd> will start a rewrite operation.  You will be prompted
for a <em>base</em> commit.  This commit and all subsequent commits up
until the current head are then put in a list of <em>Pending
commits</em>, after which the current head will be reset to the
<em>parent</em> of the base commit.  This can be configured to behave
like <code>git rebase</code>, i.e. exclude the selected base commit from the
rewrite operation, with the <code>magit-rewrite-inclusive</code> variable.
</p>
<p>You would then typically use <kbd>a</kbd> and <kbd>A</kbd> to cherry pick
commits from the list of pending commits in the desired order, until
all have been applied.  Magit shows which commits have been applied by
changing their marker from <code>*</code> to <code>.</code>.
</p>
<p>Using <kbd>A</kbd> will immediately commit the commit (as usual).  If you
want to combine multiple previous commits into a single new one, use
<kbd>a</kbd> to apply them all to your working tree, and then commit them
together.
</p>
<p>Magit has no explicit support for rewriting merge commits.  It will
happily include merge commits in the list of pending commits, but
there is no way of replaying them automatically.  You have to redo the
merge explicitly.
</p>
<p>You can also use <kbd>v</kbd> to revert a commit when you have changed your
mind.  This will change the <code>.</code> mark back to <code>*</code>.
</p>
<p>Once you are done with the rewrite, type <kbd>r s</kbd> to remove the book
keeping information from the status buffer.
</p>
<p>If you rather wish to start over, type <kbd>r a</kbd>.  This will abort the
rewriting, resetting the current head back to the value it had before
the rewrite was started with <kbd>r b</kbd>.
</p>
<p>Typing <kbd>r f</kbd> will <em>finish</em> the rewrite: it will apply all
unused commits one after the other, as if you would us <kbd>A</kbd> with
all of them.
</p>
<p>You can change the <kbd>*</kbd> and <kbd>.</kbd> marks of a pending commit
explicitly with <kbd>r *</kbd> and <kbd>r .</kbd>.
</p>
<p>In addition to a list of pending commits, the status buffer will show
the <em>Pending changes</em>.  This section shows the diff between the
original head and the current head.  You can use it to review the
changes that you still need to rewrite, and you can apply hunks from
it, like from any other diff.

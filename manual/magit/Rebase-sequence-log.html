<!-- Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.
While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each
and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced
Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks
directly from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only
Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

<h4 class="subsection">6.7.2 Rebase sequence log</h4>

<p>While a rebase sequence is in progress, the status buffer features a
section which lists the commits that have already been applied as well
as the commits that still have to be applied.
</p>
<p>The commits are split in two halves.  When rebase stops at a commit,
either because the user has to deal with a conflict or explicitly
requested that rebase stops at that commit, then point is placed on
the commit that separates the two groups, i.e. on <code>HEAD</code>.  The commits
above it have not been applied yet, while it and the commits below it
have already been applied.  In between these two groups or applied and
yet-to-be applied commits, there sometimes is a commit which has been
dropped.
</p>
<p>Each commit is prefixed with a word and these words are additionally
shown in different colors to indicate the status of the commits.
</p>
<p>The following colors are used:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Yellow commits have not been applied yet.


</li><li> Gray commits have already been applied.


</li><li> The blue commit is the <code>HEAD</code> commit.


</li><li> The green commit is the commit the rebase sequence stopped at.  If
this is the same commit as <code>HEAD</code> (e.g. because you haven&rsquo;t done
anything yet after rebase stopped at the commit, then this commit is
shown in blue, not green.  There can only be a green and a blue
commit at the same time, if you create one or more new commits after
rebase stops at a commit.


</li><li> Red commits have been dropped.  They are shown for reference only,
e.g. to make it easier to diff.
</li></ul>

<p>Of course these colors are subject to the color-theme in use.
</p>
<p>The following words are used:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Commits prefixed with <code>pick</code>, <code>reword</code>, <code>edit</code>, <code>squash</code>, and <code>fixup</code> have not
been applied yet.  These words have the same meaning here as they do
in the buffer used to edit the rebase sequence.  See <a href="Editing-rebase-sequences.html#Editing-rebase-sequences">Editing rebase sequences</a>.


</li><li> The commit prefixed with <code>onto</code> is the commit on top of which all the
other commits are being re-applied.  Like the commits that have
already been re-applied, it is reachable from <code>HEAD</code>, but unlike those
it has not actually been re-applied during the current session - it
wasn&rsquo;t touched at all.


</li><li> Commits prefixed with <code>done</code> have already been re-applied.  Not all
commits that have already been applied are prefixed with this word,
though.


</li><li> When a commit is prefixed with <code>void</code>, then that indicates that Magit
knows for sure that all the changes in that commit have been applied
using several new commits.  This commit is no longer reachable from
<code>HEAD</code>, and it also isn&rsquo;t one of the commits that will be applied when
resuming the session.


</li><li> When a commit is prefixed with <code>join</code>, then that indicates that the
rebase sequence stopped at that commit due to a conflict - you now
have to join (merge) the changes with what has already been
applied.  In a sense this is the commit rebase stopped at, but while
its effect is already in the index and in the worktree (with
conflict markers), the commit itself has not actually been applied
yet (it isn&rsquo;t the <code>HEAD</code>).  So it is shown in yellow, like the other
commits that still have to be applied.


</li><li> When a commit is prefixed with <code>goal</code>, <code>same</code>, or <code>work</code>, then that
indicates that you reset to an earlier commit (and that this commit
therefore is no longer reachable from <code>HEAD</code>), but that it might still
be possible to create a new commit with the exact same tree or at
least the same patch-id, without manually editing any file.  Or at
the very least that there are some uncommitted remaining, which
may or may not originate from that commit.

<ul>
<li> When a commit is prefixed with <code>goal</code>, then that indicates that it
is still possible to create a commit with the exact same tree
(the &quot;goal&quot;) without manually editing a file, by simply committing
the index (or, provided nothing is already staged, by staging all
unstaged changes and then committing that).  This is the case when
the original tree exists in the index or worktree in untainted
form.


</li><li> When a commit is prefixed with <code>same</code>, then that indicates that it
is no longer possible to create a commit with the exact same tree,
but that it is still possible to create a commit with the same
patch-id.  This would be the case if you created a new commit with
other changes, but the changes from the original commit still
exist in the index and/or working tree in untainted form.


</li><li> When a commit is prefixed with <code>work</code>, then that indicates that you
are working with the changes from that commit after resetting to
an earlier commit.  There are changes in the index and/or working
tree and some of them likely originate from that commit.
</li></ul>


</li><li> When a commit is prefixed with <code>poof</code> or <code>gone</code>, then that indicates
that you reset to an earlier commit (and that this commit therefore
is no longer reachable from <code>HEAD</code>), and that there are no
uncommitted changes remaining which might allow you to create a new
commit with the same tree or at least the same patch-id.

<ul>
<li> When a commit is prefixed with <code>poof</code>, then that indicates that it
is no longer reachable from <code>HEAD</code>, but that it has been replaced
with one or more commits, which together have the exact same
effect.


</li><li> When a commit is prefixed with <code>gone</code>, then that indicates that it
is no longer reachable from <code>HEAD</code> and that we also cannot determine
whether its changes are still in effect in one or more new
commits.  They might be, but if so, then there must also be other
changes which makes it impossible to know for sure.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>Do not worry if you do not fully understand the above.  That&rsquo;s okay,
you will acquire a good enough understanding through practice.
</p>
<p>For other sequence operations such as cherry-picking, a similar section
is displayed, but they lack some of the features described below, due
to limitations in the git commands used to implement them.  Most
importantly these sequences only support &quot;picking&quot; a commit but not
other actions such as &quot;rewording&quot;, and they do not keep track of the
commits which have already been applied.

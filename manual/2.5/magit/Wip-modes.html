<!-- Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.
While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each
and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced
Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks
directly from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only
Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

<h3 class="section">8.5 Wip modes</h3>

<p>Git keeps <strong>committed</strong> changes around long enough for users to recover
changes they have accidentally deleted.  It does so by not garbage
collecting any committed but no longer referenced objects for a
certain period of time, by default 30 days.
</p>
<p>But Git does <strong>not</strong> keep track of <strong>uncommitted</strong> changes in the working tree
and not even the index (the staging area).  Because Magit makes it so
convenient to modify uncommitted changes, it also makes it easy to
shoot yourself in the foot in the process.
</p>
<p>For that reason Magit provides three global modes that save <strong>tracked</strong>
files to work-in-progress references after or before certain actions.
(Untracked files are never saved and these modes also only work after
the first commit has been created).
</p>
<p>Two separate work-in-progress references are used to track the state
of the index and of the working tree: &quot;refs/wip/index/&lt;branchref&gt;&quot; and
&quot;refs/wip/wtree/&lt;branchref&gt;&quot;, where <code>&lt;branchref&gt;</code> is the full ref of the
current branch, e.g. &quot;refs/heads/master&quot;.  When the <code>HEAD</code> is detached
then &quot;HEAD&quot; is in place of <code>&lt;branchref&gt;</code>.
</p>
<p>Checking out another branch (or detaching <code>HEAD</code>) causes the use of
different wip refs for subsequent changes, but the old refs are not
deleted.
</p>
<p>Creating a commit and then making a change causes the wip refs to be
recreated to fork from the new commit.  But the old commits on the wip
refs are not lost.  They are still available from the reflog.  To make
it easier to see when the fork point of a wip ref was changed, an
additional commit with the message &quot;restart autosaving&quot; is created on
it (<code>xxO</code> commits below are such boundary commits).
</p>
<p>Starting with
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">      BI0---BI1    refs/wip/index/refs/heads/master
     /
A---B              refs/heads/master
     \
      BW0---BW1    refs/wip/wtree/refs/heads/master
</pre>
<p>and committing the staged changes and editing and saving a file would
result in
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">      BI0---BI1        refs/wip/index/refs/heads/master
     /
A---B---C              refs/heads/master
     \   \
      \   CW0---CW1    refs/wip/wtree/refs/heads/master
       \
        BW0---BW1      refs/wip/wtree/refs/heads/master@{2}
</pre>
<p>The fork-point of the index wip ref is not changed until some change
is being staged.  Likewise just checking out a branch or creating a
commit does not change the fork-point of the working tree wip ref.  The
fork-points are not adjusted until there actually is a change that
should be committed to the respective wip ref.
</p>
<p>To view the log for the a branch and its wip refs use the commands
<code>magit-wip-log</code> and <code>magit-wip-log-current</code>.  You should use <code>--graph</code> when
using these commands.  Alternatively you can use the reflog to show
all commits that ever existed on a wip ref.  You can then recover lost
changes from the commits shown in the log or reflog.
</p>
<a name="index-magit_002dwip_002dlog"></a>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-magit_002dwip_002dlog-1"></a>Command: <strong>magit-wip-log</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command shows the log for a branch and its wip refs.
</p>
<p>With a negative prefix argument only the worktree wip ref is shown.
The absolute numeric value of the prefix argument controls how many
&quot;branches&quot; of each wip ref are shown.
</p></dd></dl>

<a name="index-magit_002dwip_002dlog_002dcurrent"></a>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-magit_002dwip_002dlog_002dcurrent-1"></a>Command: <strong>magit-wip-log-current</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command shows the log for the current branch and its wip refs.
</p>
<p>With a negative prefix argument only the worktree wip ref is shown.
The absolute numeric value of the prefix argument controls how many
&quot;branches&quot; of each wip ref are shown.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>There exists a total of three global modes that save to the wip refs,
which might seem excessive, but allows fine tuning of when exactly
changes are being committed to the wip refs.  Enabling all modes makes
it less likely that a change slips through the cracks.
</p>
<p>Setting the below variable directly does not take effect; either
customize them or call the respective mode function.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-magit_002dwip_002dafter_002dsave_002dmode"></a>User Option: <strong>magit-wip-after-save-mode</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When this mode is enabled, then saving a buffer that visits a file
tracked in a Git repository causes its current state to be committed
to the working tree wip ref for the current branch.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-magit_002dwip_002dafter_002dapply_002dmode"></a>User Option: <strong>magit-wip-after-apply-mode</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When this mode is enabled, then applying (i.e. staging, unstaging,
discarding, reversing, and regularly applying) a change to a file
tracked in a Git repository causes its current state to be committed
to the index and/or working tree wip refs for the current branch.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>If you only ever edit files using Emacs and only ever interact with
Git using Magit, then the above two modes should be enough to protect
each and every change from accidental loss.  In practice nobody does
that.  So an additional mode exists that does commit to the wip refs
before making changes that could cause the loss of earlier changes.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-magit_002dwip_002dbefore_002dchange_002dmode"></a>User Option: <strong>magit-wip-before-change-mode</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When this mode is enabled, then certain commands commit the existing
changes to the files they are about to make changes to.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Note that even if you enable all three modes this won&rsquo;t give you
perfect protection.  The most likely scenario for losing changes
despite the use of these modes is making a change outside Emacs and
then destroying it also outside Emacs.  In such a scenario, Magit,
being an Emacs package, didn&rsquo;t get the opportunity to keep you from
shooting yourself in the foot.
</p>
<p>When you are unsure whether Magit did commit a change to the wip refs,
then you can explicitly request that all changes to all tracked files
are being committed.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-M_002dx-magit_002dwip_002dcommit"></a>
<a name="index-magit_002dwip_002dcommit"></a>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>M-x magit-wip-commit</kbd> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<code>magit-wip-commit</code>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command commits all changes to all tracked files to the index
and working tree work-in-progress refs.  Like the modes described above,
it does not commit untracked files, but it does check all tracked
files for changes.  Use this command when you suspect that the modes
might have overlooked a change made outside Emacs/Magit.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-magit_002dwip_002dafter_002dsave_002dlocal_002dmode_002dlighter"></a>User Option: <strong>magit-wip-after-save-local-mode-lighter</strong></dt>

<p>Mode-line lighter for <code>magit-wip-before-change-mode</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-magit_002dwip_002dnamespace"></a>User Option: <strong>magit-wip-namespace</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The namespace used for work-in-progress refs.  It has to end with a
slash.  The wip refs are named &quot;&lt;namespace&gt;index/&lt;branchref&gt;&quot; and
&quot;&lt;namespace&gt;wtree/&lt;branchref&gt;&quot;.  When snapshots are created while
the <code>HEAD</code> is detached then &quot;HEAD&quot; is used in place of <code>&lt;branchref&gt;</code>.
</p></dd></dl>
